This is the code to a discord bot that I created while a part of the WPI Mental Health Committee. Two of my classmates, Sarah Kogan and Rachel Foye, assisted with the concepts and slightly with the coding (espeically when there were errors) but I handled the majority of the actual coding as I had the most time to commit and I was the most involved in the committee at the time. The bot's main function is chat filtering - it will delete any chats that have mentions of words that could potentially be harmful to individuals who struggle with mental health (for example, "suicide", "self harm", etc.) and restate these messages but with those words and phrases blocked out, and explicitly mentioning at the beginning that there was mention of these topics in the message. Some secondary functions of the bot include spreading positivity, which is done with an in-chat command by a user and the bot says a random positive affirmation from a text document of affirmations. The bot can also list its commands, and we are working on ideas for other functions to include as well.
